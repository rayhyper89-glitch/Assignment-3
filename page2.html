          Sonic's base design was based off an originally discarded sketch of a character named "Mr. Hedgehog" by Ohshima.
          The team settled on Sonic's final name to represent speed and took the name Sonic Team.
          Sonic was designed to be easy for children to draw.
          His blue color was adjusted several times to match Sega's logo and improve contrast.
          Ohshima combined Felix the Cat's head with Mickey Mouse's body, with inspiration from Michael Jackson’s album
          <em>Bad</em> and Santa Claus’s costume for Sonic’s shoes.
          Sonic was created without the ability to swim due to a mistaken assumption that hedgehogs could not swim.
